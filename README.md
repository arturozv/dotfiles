# Dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repository. It is for bootstrapping new machines.

# Use

First, make sure **zsh** is installed. MacOS has it by default. For Ubuntu, run

```
sudo apt install zsh
sudo apt-get install powerline fonts-powerline
```

To Setup dotfiles, run

```
git clone git@github.com:kyeotic/dotfiles.git
./dotfiles/link.sh
./dotfiles/init.sh
```
